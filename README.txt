Your project should include a README file containing the following information:

1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library

numpy==2.1.3
opencv_python==4.10.0.84
pillow==11.0.0

2. how to run each task and where to look for the output file.

Running only the main.py file will output the results for all the 3 tasks.

The photo with the empty table from the "imagini_auxiliare" folder is needed because in code I use it as below
empty_table_path = "imagini_auxiliare\\01.jpg"

how to run : python main.py <input_folder_name>, where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the images for task1
             - if the folder is nested like "evaluare\fake_test"  it still works
output: the output files for all the tasks are found in folder evaluare/fisiere_solutie/461_Andronic_Smaranda, where the naming conventions for the score files and the positions for the new pieces are met
